The City of Silverlight
The City of Silverlight is a bustling metropolis built around the shimmering Lake Seraphina. Its prosperity is rooted in the mining of a rare, luminous crystal known as Aetherium, found in the nearby Crystal Peaks. The city is governed by the Luminarch Council, a group of powerful mages and merchants.
